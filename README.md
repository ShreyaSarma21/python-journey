# Python 30-Day Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Python learning journey, where I code daily for 30 days.

### 📅 Day 1 – Python Basics
- ✅ Installed Python
- ✅ Ran my first script (`day1_basics.py`)
- ✅ Set up Git and pushed to GitHub

### 📅 Day 2 – Data Types & Converter
- ✅ Practiced Python data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
- ✅ Wrote type conversion examples (`day2_data_types.py`)
- ✅ Built a KM → Miles converter (`day2_converter.py`)
- ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub

### 📅 Day 3 – Control Flow (Enhanced)
- ✅ Practiced `if`, `elif`, `else` with logic-based flows
- ✅ Wrote a grading/weather alert program
- ✅ Enhanced login checker with masked input + 3 retry attempts
- ✅ Committed and pushed via VS Code

### 🛠️ Mini Project – User Dashboard
- ✅ Combines Day 1–3 concepts: input, data types, logic, login
- ✅ Verifies user login (3 attempts)
- ✅ Takes age, place, and distance to calculate miles
- ✅ Gives weather suggestion based on temperature

### 📅 Day 4 – Loops
- ✅ Practiced `for` and `while` loops
- ✅ Learned how to use `break`, `continue`, and `range()`
- ✅ Built a number guessing game using loops and logic

### 🎯 Upgraded: Guessing Game v2
- ✅ Random number added using `random.randint()`
- ✅ Input validation added using `try/except`
- ✅ Displays remaining attempts and user guidance
- ✅ Final version of Day 4's project

### 📅 Day 5 – Functions
- ✅ Learned how to define and reuse custom functions
- ✅ Created `convert_km_to_miles`, `check_age_group`, and `validate_login`
- ✅ Used a main function to organize execution
